I'm Rotem, a young software developer from Israel. I mostly code in Java but I know several other languages.

Right now, I'm working on a couple of cool projects:

* A Java client for Israel's most used digital school management system, Mashov ([rootatkali/MashovAPI](https://github.com/rootatkali/MashovAPI))
* Numerous projects in my school, [HaKfar HaYarok](https://github.com/kfaryarok)
* A bunch of other projects I can't announce yet... :wink:

### Fun facts about me
